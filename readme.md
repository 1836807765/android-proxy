Android Proxy Library (APL) provides an abstraction layer to easily get the proxy settings from an Android device, in order to find a better and easy solution to the Android's Issue 1273 for both developers and users. Since it has been clarified from Google's spokesman that the versions 1.x-2.x won't receive an official proxy support, APL allows to abstract the device version and easily get the proxy settings on every released Android device.
