# Proxy Settings 
**Proxy Settings** provides a set of tools to ease the access and the modification of proxy server configuration into Android devices, when you are connected to any Wi-Fi (at the moment setting the proxy on Mobile network is not supported).

Please remember that configuring the proxy doesn't mean that all your applications will automatically start to using these 
settings! This is due to a not easy understandable API for developers. If you are interested in a deeper analysis of this issue, you can find a detailed explanation of the problem and leave your feedbacks/comments on our website: [http://shouldit.be/](http://shouldit.be/), or just open an issue here.
